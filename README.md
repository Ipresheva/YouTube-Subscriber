# YouTube-Subcriber
A program using VBScript and Batch that opens up a channel on YouTube, then automatically subscribes to it!
# Usage
To use this program, just clone the repository and start the "subscriber.bat" file. Enter the URL of the channel you want the program to subscribe or unsubscribe to in the second line of the batch file. Some things to note: The amount of times the VBScript file has to spam tab may vary. For example, if a channel you want to set the program to subscribe to has a "join" button, you will need to increase the first loop in the VBScript file by one. If you want to turn this program into an unsubscriber instead of a subscriber, just change the second VBScript loop from one to two.
